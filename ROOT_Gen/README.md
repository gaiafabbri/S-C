## Generation_Images.C
The dataset generation process utilizes the Generation.C module within the ROOT folder through the function "Generation". It prompts the user to choose between using a default file generated with dimensions 16x16 and 100,000 events for signal and background, or generating a custom dataset. In the latter case, the user has the freedom to define the dataset dimensions and image format, even non-square ones, with certain constraints. It is necessary to specify that the code was tested woth the default configuration, so we expect differen performances if the dataset is changed.

The "Generation" function requires three parameters: the number of images to generate ("n"), the height ("nh"), and the width ("nw") of the images. It defines a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution for both the signal and background using the ROOT TF2 class. The parameter "nRndmEvts" determines the number of events used to fill each image, representing the number of random events sampled from the signal and background distributions to create a single image example. A higher value of "nRndmEvts" can lead to more defined and realistic images but requires more computational resources to generate the data. Therefore, it is set to 10,000 (non-modifiable). The parameter "delta_sigma" represents the percentage difference in standard deviation (sigma) between the signal and background distributions. A higher value increases the difference between the widths of the background and signal distributions, making them easier to be distinguished. It is also set to 5% and is non-modifiable. Random noise is added to the signal, linked to the variable "pixelNoise", representing the level of noise added to each pixel of the generated image. It measures the dispersion or random variation of pixel values.

The variables "sX1", "sY1", "sX2", "sY2" represent the sigma values along the x and y axes for the first and second Gaussian distributions, respectively, where "sX2" is increased by 5% compared to "sX1", and "sY2" is decreased by 5% compared to "sY1". Two TH2D histograms are created using ROOT to store the data, along with two TF2 functions representing the Gaussian distributions. Two TTree trees are then created: one for signal data (sig_tree) and one for background data (bkg_tree). Branches of the trees ("vars") are defined to contain the image data, using a pointer to a float vector to store the data.


 The two functions, "f1.SetParameters(1, 5, sX1, 5, sY1)" and "f2.SetParameters(1, 5, sX2, 5, sY2)" are used to set the distribution of data within the images and are defined with the following parameters, in order:
- Maximum height of the Gaussian
- Mean position along the x-axis
- Standard deviation along the x-axis
- Mean position along the y-axis
- Standard deviation along the y-axis

Inside the firstloop, the instructions "h1.FillRandom("f1", nRndmEvts)" and "h2.FillRandom("f2", nRndmEvts)" fill the histograms h1 and h2 with randomly generated data using the functions f1 and f2, respectively. The FillRandom() function takes the name of a function (in this case, f1 and f2) as an argument and generates random values for the histogram variables distributed according to the specified function's distribution.

A second loop iterates through all cells (or bins) of the image, where "nh" represents the number of rows and "nw" represents the number of columns of the image. This loop traverses through each row and column of the image, allowing access and manipulation of each individual bin of the two-dimensional histogram. An index "m" is calculated for each bin, representing the position of the bin in the two-dimensional array x1 and x2. This is done by multiplying the row index by the number of columns and adding the column index. This index "m" is used to access the vectors x1 and x2, which contain the image data. For each bin of the image, random Gaussian noise is added using the function "gRandom->Gaus(0, pixelNoise)", which generates a random number distributed according to a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation "pixelNoise". This noise is added to the value of the bin obtained from the respective histograms h1 and h2, resulting in image data with added noise.
